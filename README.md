##1) Forking the repository
On the Github GUI for github.com/Helen-Zhao/softeng-306-p1, click the "fork" button on the top right corner. Select your own account (i.e. instead of Helen-Zhao/softeng-306-p1 choose John-Doe/softeng-306-p1). Then, navigate to your newly forked directory on github (github.com/John-Doe/softeng-306-p1) and copy the "clone or download" link.  

##2) Cloning into the repo with SSH
Navigate to the folder you want to store your local copy of the repository. Right click, `Open Git BASH here`. If you're using SSH, simply type `git clone git@github.com:John-Doe/softeng-306-p1.git` into the terminal (the repository you're cloning into being the one that was just forked). You can create as many branches and stuff if you want

##) Creating a pull request
Go to the Github GUI and on the top left click "New pull request". Select Helen-Zhao/dev as the one to merge to and your local and the one you're merging from.
